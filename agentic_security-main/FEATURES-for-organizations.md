# Agentic Security - Features for Organizations

This feature list outlines the advanced capabilities of Agentic Security to assist in integrating high-security, low-latency language model applications into organizational infrastructure, with a particular focus on detecting and preventing prompt injection and jailbreak attempts.

## 1. Exclusive Pentest with a 40k Jailbreak Dataset

Private pentesting services using an exclusive dataset of 40,000 jailbreak attempts, ensuring unparalleled security and prompt injection prevention.

## 2. Unique Threat Vector Identification

Identifies and mitigates unique threat vectors, providing a tailored security posture against sophisticated attacks.

## 3. Continuous Feedback and LLMOps Integration

Implements feedback loops and LLMOps for continuous monitoring and improvement, ensuring optimal performance and security.

## 4. Reduced dependencies

Self-Contained Runtime Environment: Agentic Security operates within a self-contained runtime. This significantly lowers the barrier to entry for organizations by minimizing the complexity typically associated with setting up and maintaining LLM applications and infra.

This library approach not only simplifies the architecture but also reduces potential points of failure and latency issues associated with external dependencies
